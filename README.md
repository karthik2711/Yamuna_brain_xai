# Image-Based Deep Learning Study

This repository provides the reproducible implementation for the image-based
model proposed in the Scientific Reports submission.

## Structure
- Image preprocessing
- CNN-based model
- Training and evaluation pipeline

## How to Run
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --data_path data/sample_images --epochs 15

## Note
Sample images are provided for reproducibility. Original datasets are restricted.
